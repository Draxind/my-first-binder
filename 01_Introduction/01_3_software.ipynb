    "To use Jupyter notebooks you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CentOS 6 or later or some other recent Linux distribution, macOS 10.13 or later, or Windows 8 or later\n",
    "- 5&nbsp;GB available on your disk\n",
    "- an up-to-date version of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,\n",
    "  as notebooks are not guaranteed to work well with other browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Anaconda, a free software collection for Linux, Mac and Windows\n",
    "that includes Python, Jupyter and other libraries used in M269.\n",
    "To install Anaconda, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the Individual Edition of Anaconda with Python 3.8 or later from\n",
    "   https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.\n",
    "   To find out whether you have a 32- or 64-bit Windows version,\n",
    "   click the Start button, select Settings > System > About, and then,\n",
    "   under 'Device specifications', see 'System type'.\n",
    "2. Check any other system requirements at\n",
    "   https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install and\n",
    "   follow the installation instructions. Your operating system may warn you\n",
    "   that the installer requires access to the downloads folder. That's fine.\n",
    "   You can skip the optional step to install PyCharm: it's not needed in M269.\n",
    "3. If you have problems during installation,\n",
    "   see https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you must put the `custom.css` file that styles notebooks in its right\n",
    "place. The file is currently in the `book` folder that was extracted from\n",
    "the archive you downloaded from the [M269 website](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=208089).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do the next steps using the graphical interface of your file explorer.\n",
    "On macOS, you must press Cmd-Shift-. in the Finder before step&nbsp;4 and\n",
    "after step&nbsp;6 in order to show (and then hide again) all files and folders\n",
    "with names starting with a dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a folder `.jupyter` (note the dot) in your home folder.\n",
    "   If your username is `me`, then your home folder is usually\n",
    "   `/home/me` on Linux, `/Users/me` on macOS, and `C:\\Users\\me` on Windows.\n",
    "5. Create a subfolder of `.jupyter` named `custom`.\n",
    "6. Move or copy the `custom.css` file from the `book` folder to the `custom`\n",
    "   folder. (I prefer to copy in order to keep a backup in the `book` folder.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, do steps 4–6 with the command line, as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have Linux or macOS:\n",
    "    4. Open a terminal.\n",
    "    5. Enter `mkdir -p ~/.jupyter/custom`.\n",
    "    6. Enter `cp .../book/custom.css ~/.jupyter/custom`,\n",
    "       replacing `...` with the path to your M269 folder, e.g.\n",
    "       `cp ~/Documents/M269/book/custom.css ~/.jupyter/custom`.\n",
    "- If you have Windows:\n",
    "    4. Open the Command Prompt.\n",
    "    5. Enter `mkdir .jupyter`, then `mkdir .jupyter\\custom`.\n",
    "    6. Enter `copy ...\\book\\custom.css .jupyter\\custom`,\n",
    "       replacing `...` with the path to your M269 folder, e.g.\n",
    "       `copy C:\\Users\\me\\Documents\\M269\\book\\custom.css .jupyter\\custom`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start using Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you use Linux or macOS:\n",
    "    7. Open a terminal (or use the one you opened in step&nbsp;4 above),\n",
    "       and enter `jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "- If you use Windows:\n",
    "    7. Run the application Anaconda3 > Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your operating system may ask which browser you want to use.\n",
    "After a few moments, your chosen (or default) web browser opens the\n",
    "_notebook dashboard_, with a list of the files and folders in your home folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Jupyter interface may have changed slightly since I took this screenshot.\n",
    "Minor changes in the user interface don't affect these instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Keep clicking on folders to navigate to where you put the M269 book:\n",
    "\n",
    "![This screenshot, again of Jupyter's dashboard,\n",
    "now shows the folder with the M269 book. It has three subfolders named\n",
    "'html', 'notebooks' and 'python'.](01_3_dashboard_book.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Click on the `notebooks` folder and then on the `M269.ipynb` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens a new web browser tab with the M269 cover notebook.\n",
    "It looks like this, but with a longer table of contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "![This screenshot shows the top-level M269 notebook, with the cover image,\n",
    "a copyright notice and a link to the Introduction chapter.](01_3_cover.png) <!-- To do: Figure will need updating as it refers to it being a work in progress. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Click on the 'Introduction' link. You get something like this in a new tab:\n",
    "\n",
    "![This screenshot shows the first notebook of Chapter&nbsp;1. It has a title, Introduction, a few paragraphs of text, and\n",
    "seven links to the corresponding sections of Chapter&nbsp;1.\n",
    "At the bottom of the notebook there are two links,\n",
    "named 'Up' and 'Next chapter'.](01_3_introduction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Click on the link to the fourth section, 'Notebooks'.\n",
    "    You get something like this in a new tab:\n",
    "\n",
    "![This screenshot shows the start of the Section&nbsp;1.4 notebook. ](01_4_notebooks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the last two steps show, every time you click on a link to a notebook,\n",
    "it's opened in a new tab. Unfortunately, if the notebook is already open,\n",
    "the browser will open another copy of that notebook.\n",
    "It's therefore easy to end up with lots of tabs, several of them showing the\n",
    "same notebook. Make sure you close notebooks that you don't need anymore.\n",
    "(I'll tell you how to properly close a notebook later.)\n",
    "Avoid clicking on the 'previous section' link at the end of each notebook:\n",
    "you probably have it already open.\n",
    "You can easily see which sections you opened from the tab titles:\n",
    "they start with the chapter and section number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now start working through the notebook you just opened."

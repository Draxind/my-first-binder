    "The M269 books are this one and one titled _Logic and the limits of Computing_.\n",
    "The latter covers the last third of the module.\n",
    "You will receive a printed copy of it, but it's also available\n",
    "on the M269 website and you can download it in Word, Kindle and ePUB formats.\n",
    "As for this book, it's provided in three formats:\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks, PDF and HTML. Each has its advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF format is read-only. Using a free PDF\n",
    "reader, you can read the PDF book on a tablet, use the PDF's table\n",
    "of contents to jump to any subsection, and quickly search\n",
    "for a particular word over the whole book. Depending on the PDF reader and the\n",
    "accessibility settings of your computer, you can even have the book's content\n",
    "read to you, e.g. during commuting,\n",
    "but code and technical notation may be read out incorrectly.\n",
    "A PDF reader also allows you to bookmark pages, highlight passages, add notes\n",
    "and print pages, e.g. the summary section at the end of most chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML book is read-only too. You can read it with any web browser.\n",
    "As with the PDF book, you can search for any word, go directly to any section,\n",
    "and possibly have the content read to you.\n",
    "You can also bookmark and print HTML pages.\n",
    "Each one is a complete section, corresponding to several PDF pages.\n",
    "You can change the font size of the HTML book with your browser's\n",
    "zoom in and zoom out commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that contain both text and code.\n",
    "I mean real, executable, editable code, not static text in a monospaced font.\n",
    "With notebooks, you don't need to constantly switch between a text-only book\n",
    "and a programming environment. So you'll have more time for practice.\n",
    "The M269 TMAs are notebooks too, to save you and your tutor time from\n",
    "handling separate files with the TMA questions, your answers and your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are editable. You will edit the notebooks we provide to fix\n",
    "errata and to write answers to exercises and TMA questions. You may add\n",
    "study notes, alternative solutions, wrong solutions and comments why\n",
    "they're wrong. Upon completing M269, you will have unique notebooks,\n",
    "with _your_ answers and notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with Jupyter notebooks requires a laptop or desktop computer,\n",
    "with a proper keyboard and a decent-sized screen.\n",
    "There's one Jupyter notebook per book section, to keep them relatively small.\n",
    "Unlike with the PDF and HTML formats,\n",
    "you can't easily search for a term across all notebooks,\n",
    "only within a single notebook. It's also not as easy to highlight passages and\n",
    "make notes in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook files have the extension '.ipynb', which comes from their original\n",
    "name: IPython notebooks. (IPython stands for interactive Python.)\n",
    "Do _not_ double-click on a notebook to open it: this\n",
    "will probably open a text editor showing the internal format of a notebook.\n",
    "If you have double-clicked on a notebook, then immediately close the editor without changing the file. The next section\n",
    "explains how to install the necessary software to use notebooks.\n",
    "Once the software is installed,\n",
    "you'll be able to work on notebooks with a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for accessibility or other reasons you can't use Jupyter notebooks, you can instead use the\n",
    "provided Python files, one per notebook, with all the code in that notebook.\n",
    "Some code is specific to Jupyter, but most of it can be executed in any Python\n",
    "environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most book sections have exercises.\n",
    "At the end of each one there's a link to its answer.\n",
    "Most exercises also have a link to a hint. Each hint and answer is\n",
    "in a separate notebook (and separate page in the HTML version),\n",
    "so that you don't accidentally see the hint or answer for the next exercise.\n",
    "However, the PDF version has several hints and answers on the same page.\n",
    "Once you have read the hint or answer in HTML or PDF, you can return to the\n",
    "exercise by using the 'back' command of your browser or PDF app.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book uses a few conventions, explained next.\n",
    "All formats look slightly different, due to the way the PDF and HTML books are\n",
    "generated from the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises are numbered consecutively from 1 in each section,\n",
    "so that you can easily refer to them in the forums and tutorials.\n",
    "For example, Exercise&nbsp;1.3.2 is the second exercise of Section&nbsp;3 of Chapter&nbsp;1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides exercises, the book has short questions\n",
    "to check your understanding of the concepts.\n",
    "Each question and its answer are separated by a horizontal line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the lines as 'stop and think' signs. At these points\n",
    "you should stop reading, answer the question in your head,\n",
    "and then continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terms in bold, e.g. **algorithm**, may occur in the assessment.\n",
    "You must be able to understand these terms and use them in your answers.\n",
    "You don't have to memorise definitions."

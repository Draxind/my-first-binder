    "Algorithms, data structures and computability have been core topics of\n",
    "Computing courses around the world for decades, and for a good reason.\n",
    "The first two topics are eminently practical: knowledge of how to\n",
    "structure data, construct algorithms and analyse their efficiency\n",
    "is useful for the design and implementation of any software system.\n",
    "It's knowledge you can immediately put to use in other modules\n",
    "and in your professional life.\n",
    "The third topic is somewhat theoretical, but it is _the_ Computer Science topic.\n",
    "Computability addresses the fundamental questions of what computation is\n",
    "and what can and can't be computed.\n",
    "I'm sure you will find M269 useful and intellectually stimulating.\n",
    "\n",
    "M269 is organised in three 'blocks', each roughly covering one topic:\n",
    "first data structures, then algorithms and finally computability.\n",
    "Each block shows you how to solve computational problems by applying the\n",
    "concepts and techniques learned. As in most modules, you can expect\n",
    "the material to get more difficult as you progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurring theme of M269 is abstraction. As you shall see later,\n",
    "an algorithm is an abstraction of the steps executed by a computer,\n",
    "data structures abstract the relationships between the data being processed,\n",
    "and the complexity of an algorithm is an abstraction of its run-time.\n",
    "Abstracting from problem-specific details leads to general models, rules\n",
    "and concepts that help us tackle new problems: that's the power of abstraction.\n",
    "The cover of this book illustrates the abstraction process:\n",
    "from a detailed representation to a general geometric shape, the rectangle."
